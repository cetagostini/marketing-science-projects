# BigQuery ML for Marketing Science
Welcome to my BigQuery ML for Marketing Science projects repository! Here, you'll find a collection of projects that show you how to use BigQuery ML to solve real-world marketing problems.

📊 The first practice in this repository is an introduction to BigQuery ML where we build a simple ARIMA model for time series forecasting. We will be showing how to use SQL to prepare data and use BigQuery ML to train and evaluate the model.

🔎 The goal of this repository is to provide an easy way for marketing practitioners and researchers to use machine learning in BigQuery to improve their analysis and make data-driven decisions.

🤝 We would love for you to collaborate with us on these projects, so if you have any questions or ideas, please don't hesitate to reach out! We are open for contributions and we are looking forward to hearing from you!
