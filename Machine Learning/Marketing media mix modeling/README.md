# Bayesian MMM (Media Mix Modeling)
Welcome to my project on Bayesian MMM! Here, you will find a way to implement Media Mix Modeling (MMM) using Prophet and PyMC3, following the papers "Bayesian Methods for Media Mix Modeling with Carryover and Shape Effects" and "Carryover and Shape Effects in Media Mix Modeling". Additionally, you will find my own experiences and insights on the implementation of this method.

📊 Media Mix Modeling is a statistical method that allows you to understand the impact of different marketing channels on sales and make data-driven budget allocation decisions.

🧪 By using Bayesian methods, this project provides a more robust and flexible approach to MMM, taking into account carryover and shape effects.

🤝 We would love for you to collaborate with us on this project, so if you have any questions or ideas, please don't hesitate to reach out! We are open for contributions and we are looking forward to hearing from you!

🔥 More content is coming, stay tuned!
