# NLP for App Reviews Analysis
Welcome to my project on NLP for App Reviews Analysis! Here, you will find a way to scrape app reviews from the Google Play Store and extract insights on app quality, user engagement, feature requests, and general sentiment.

📱 With this project, you will be able to understand what users are saying about your app, and make data-driven improvements.

📊 The project uses natural language processing (NLP) techniques to classify and analyze the reviews, providing a comprehensive understanding of user feedback.

🤝 We would love for you to collaborate with us on this project, so if you have any questions or ideas, please don't hesitate to reach out! We are open for contributions and we are looking forward to hearing from you!

🔥 More content is coming, stay tuned!
