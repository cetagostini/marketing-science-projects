# Machine Learning for Marketing
Welcome to my Machine Learning for Marketing projects repository! Here, you'll find a collection of projects that apply machine learning to solve real-world marketing problems.

📱 **Project 1: App Sentiment Analysis** - In this project, we scrape reviews of an app from Google Play, using natural language processing (NLP) techniques to classify the comments and uncover underlying feedback. This project allows you to understand the sentiment and quality of your app, and make data-driven improvements.

📊 **Project 2: Ad Feature Analysis** - In this project, we use logistic regression to understand the best features in your ads, in order to reproduce the things that work better to build a creative strategy driven by data.

💸 **Project 3: Media Mix Modeling** - In this project, we use Prophet and PyMC3 to model the sales baseline and understand how online marketing collaborates with our sales. This project allows you to understand the impact of different marketing channels and make data-driven budget allocation decisions.

🤝 We would love for you to collaborate with us on these projects, so if you have any questions or ideas, please don't hesitate to reach out! We are open for contributions and we are looking forward to hearing from you!
