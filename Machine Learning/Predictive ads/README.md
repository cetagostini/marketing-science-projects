# Model Experimentation for Ad Classification
Welcome to my project on Model Experimentation for Ad Classification! Here, you will find a process of experimenting with various models to solve a classification problem. The goal is to learn the different features of several online ads, in order to determine the probability of success of a new ad with certain characteristics.

📊 In this project, I tested different models of supervised and unsupervised learning, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, K-Means, and others. I also provide a proof of concept on how to save the trained models in a file to be consumed later.

🔎 This project is not fully optimized, but it serves as a great starting point for understanding how I quickly work with datasets and experiment with different models.

🤝 I would love for you to collaborate with us on this project, so if you have any questions or ideas, please don't hesitate to reach out! We are open for contributions and we are looking forward to hearing from you!

🔥 More content is coming, stay tuned!

Happy experimenting!
