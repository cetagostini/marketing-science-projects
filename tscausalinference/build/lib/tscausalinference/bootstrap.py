    Notes:
    - This function uses the bootstrap method to resample the input data with replacement.
    - For each bootstrap sample, a random walk is simulated based on the resampled data.
    - The random walk starts at the mean of the resampled data, and each step is a random draw from a standard normal
      distribution.
    - The variance of the random walk is adjusted to match the variance of the resampled data.
    - The resulting random walk is saved as one of the bootstrap samples.
    - The function returns an array of shape (n_samples, n_steps), where each row represents a bootstrap sample.

    - treatment: a numpy array or pandas dataframe containing data from the treatment group
    - simulations: a numpy array of bootstrap samples generated using the `bootstrap_simulate` function

    Notes:
    - This function assumes that the data in both control and treatment groups are normally distributed.
    - The p-value is calculated using a two-sided hypothesis test.
    - The null hypothesis is that the means of the two groups are equal.
    - The alternative hypothesis is that the means of the two groups are not equal.
    - The p-value is calculated as the proportion of bootstrapped means that are more extreme than the observed
      difference in means between the control and treatment groups.
    - A confidence interval is also calculated for the difference in means, based on the bootstrapped means.
    - If the `mape` argument is provided, the bootstrapped means are adjusted to account for potential error in the
      bootstrap sampling process.
    - The `prob_in_distribution` function is used to calculate the p-value based on the bootstrapped means.
