    """
    Simulates bootstrap samples using a random walk process based on the input data.
    
    The function follows the principles of bootstrapping, which is a resampling method used to estimate the distribution of a statistic from a sample of data. Bootstrapping involves repeatedly resampling the original data with replacement to create new samples of the same size as the original sample. Each new sample is used to calculate the statistic of interest, and the distribution of these calculated statistics is used to estimate the distribution of the statistic in the population.

    Args:
        data: A 1D array-like object containing the original data.
        n_samples: An integer representing the number of bootstrap samples to generate.
        n_steps: An integer representing the number of steps in the random walk process.

    Returns:
        An array of shape (n_samples, n_steps) containing the bootstrap samples generated by the random walk process.
