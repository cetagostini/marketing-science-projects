a) The standard deviation of the residuals is {}. This means that the noise in your data is {}.

Summary

During the intervention period, the response variable had an average value of approximately {}. 
By contrast, in the absence of an intervention, we would have expected an average response of {}. 
The 95% confidence interval of this counterfactual prediction is {} to {}.

The usual error of your model is {}%, while the difference during the intervention period is {}%. 
During the intervention, the error increase {}% ({} percentage points), suggesting some factor is 
impacting the quality of the model, and the differences are significant.

The probability of obtaining this effect by chance is very small

This means that the causal effect can be considered statistically significant.
