# Boosting Ads with Google Cloud Vision
Welcome to my project on Boosting Ads with Google Cloud Vision! Here, you will learn how to use the Google Cloud Vision API on Python to analyze online ads and extract the main features such as colors, objects, and text. Additionally, you will find a function to classify colors in RGB format and return the main color name.

📷 With this project, you will be able to extract insights from your ads images to understand which colors, objects and text are more attractive to your target audience.

🔍 The goal of this project is to provide an easy way for marketing practitioners and researchers to use the power of Google Cloud Vision to improve their analysis and make data-driven decisions.

🤝 We would love for you to collaborate with us on this project, so if you have any questions or ideas, please don't hesitate to reach out! We are open for contributions and we are looking forward to hearing from you!
